As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone
who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call,
I heard the thief say that they were planning to take
the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
The thief then asked the person on the other end of
the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
